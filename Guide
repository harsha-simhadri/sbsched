- To switch between centralized / decentralized locking, choose the option in config.mk, set LIBVER

- Dont use default constructors for creating continuations, it copies locks with in jobs. Write own new constructor that uses ":SizedJob(del)" to freshly instantiate base class object entries

- Always annotate strands that are continuations of each other with the same size function, else HR_Scheduler wont work

- Use machine-config.hh file to choose machine selection

- After generate test data, "flush" caches by reading a big object to avoid caching issues

- ??? Not implemented ??? How to memory manage? Separate large allocations from small allocations? Create new routine newA?

- Tune samplesort base params and kernel

- To use block tranpose, call the sizing function first. And while passing offsets, compute the last offset beyond all elements, ie, the (n+1)-th entry

- Resetting thread affinity in the middle of the task does not seem to work. Setting it up front seems fine.

- Dont use rand() funciton, is probably a bottleneck as it needs to lock the seed variable to update it.

TO DO

Sanity checks in scheduler. 
(a) Continuations should have same space as their matching threads
(b) Check when deleting an active set if the space has been reduced to zero
(c) Reject zero space jobs


Validate space annotations. Check if the number of cache misses matches up with annotation.
In a sequential run: flush the cache before starting a subtask, you can check for both over- and under-estimation 
of space annotations

Clean up
(a) Remove file loggin from performace countesrs
